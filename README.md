# Advanced Technologies
There are two versions of the mod. 
Choose the one you want (All techs unlocked or Normal) and copy all contents of the folder into
/Interplanetary/Interplanetary_Data/StreamingAssets/Data folder. 

Ingame, go into the options menu and in the misc section check "Custom Data Files". Start a NEW game and the mod should become active. 

Please note that I did not create the game, I am not associated with Team Jolly Roger or any other person/company who made the game, and I only changed the modable files.
I am not responsible for anything bad that might happen when you download these files.
