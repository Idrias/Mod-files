Changelog v1.0, Prototype 1:
	
	General:
		- Nuclear power plant now has 5 power connectors
		- Shields now also protect against missiles
		- Range of Solar Laser and Asteroid Diversion attacks increased (range x ~2)
		- Orbital Assembly, Gamma Ray Lasers, Autonomous Orbital Assembly, Advaced Spectral Analysis, Gravity Well Mapping, Atomic Refineries, Gravitational Lensing techs now unlocked from the beginning

	Lossless Energy Transfer (Technology):
		- Now costs 1200 research points instead of 650
		- SSTAR Reactor Trials (Project): Now leaves global material yield unchanged and instead sets global energy yield to 4xNormal (+300%)
		- Advanced Munitions Factory (Project): Now reduces fire cost by 75%
		- Superconducting Grid Access (Upgrade): Increases nuclear power plant energy yield by 100%, material cost x 1.3

	Experimental Matter Control (Technology):
		- Now costs 1200 research points instead of 1000
		- Electromagnetic Jamming (Project): Now adds (local) 10000 city stealth, sets global population yield to x0.9, global science yield to x1.25
		  (Background: Electromagnetic Jamming completly hides any city signals from the enemy's radar. Scientists are now able to have high signal noise experiments without the
	           enemy noticing. Death rate is increased due to the ongoing Jamming)
		- Rare material synthesis (Project): Global material yield now x3

	Robotic Mining (Technology):
		- Now costs 1200 research points instead of 900
		- Ultrasonic Pulse Unit (Upgrade): Material yield x4, material consumption x1.5
		- Autonomous Mining Robotics (Upgrade): Material yield x4, material consumption x1.5

	Advanced Genetics (Technology):
		- Now costs 1200 research points instead of 1000
		- Cloning Initiative (Project): Increases local population yield by factor 200 for one turn, resulting in maximized population 
		- Covert Humanoid Experimentation: Increase your science yield by factor 10, population LOSS of 5x normal population yield
		(Background: As soon as cloning is a real thing in your empire, your scientists beg to be able to conduct some more... delicate
		experiments. This crude method is able to wipe out entire cities, yet results in enormous breakthrougs in science)

	Magnetic Lensing (Technology):
		- Now costs 1200 research points instead of 800
		- 2nd Gen Projection -> Now called Planetary Hull Projection
		- Planetary Hull Projection (Upgrade): Defending chance x0.5, shield covers entire planet, activation cost x20
		- Optimized Activation Sequence (Upgrade): Defending chance x 2, activation cost x0.01, 3 turns to build
		(Background: Planetary Hull Projection will result in a gigantic force field covering ever last spot of the planet. Such a huge shield consumes inmense ammounts of energy and 
		has a much higher failure rate than the normal shields. To increase the defense probability and reduce the cost caused by false alarms, your scientists calibrate the shield. This
		takes 3 rounds.)

	Quantum Communications (Technology):
		- Now costs 1200 research points instead of 550
		- Behavioral Pattern Analysis (Project): global Intelligence yield x10
		- Quantum Encryption Hub (Project): global Counterintelligence yield x20
		- Data Processing Center (Upgrade): Intelligence yield / t +42, Counterintelligence yield / t +42
		(Background: Using Quantum Communications, your spies can analyse and encrypt LOTS of data. And by lots I mean 10-20 times as much. Looking at already gathered intel we will be able
		to predict where the enemy is going to place his next buildings)
